# Maze-Generator-Solver-with-Tkinter-DAA-Project

This project explores how search algorithms can be used to both generate and solve mazes in a structured, visual, and interactive environment. Mazes are an excellent way to simulate problem-solving scenarios, allowing us to compare the efficiency and behavior of different algorithmic strategies under various conditions.


âž¢ Algorithms Used (Five Distinct Searching Algoritms):

1. Depth-First Search (DFS)

2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

4. A* Search

5. Greedy Best-First
